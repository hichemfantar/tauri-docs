Tauri provides application and plugin developers with a capabilities system,
to granually enable and constrain the core exposure to the application frontend running in the
system WebView.

Capabilities are a set of [permissions](/security/permissions/) mapped
to application windows and webviews by their respective label.
Capabilities can affect multiple windows and webviews and these can be
referenced in multiple capabilities.

:::tip[Security Tip]

Windows and WebViews which are part of more than one capability
effectivly merge the security boundaries and permissions of all
involved capabilities.

:::

Capability files are either defined as a JSON or a TOML file
inside the `src-tauri/capabilities` directory.

It is good practice to use individual files and only reference
them by identifier in the `tauri.conf.json` but it is also possible
to define them directly in the `capabilities` field.

All capabilities inside the `capabilities` directory are automatically enabled
by default.
Once capabilities are explicitly enabled in the `tauri.conf.json`,
only these are used in the application build.

For a full reference of the configuration scheme please see the
[references](/reference/config/) section.

The following example JSON defines a capability that enables default functionality
for core plugins and the `window.setTitle` API.

```json title="src-tauri/capabilities/default.json"
{
  "$schema": "./schemas/desktop-schema.json",
  "identifier": "main-capability",
  "description": "Capability for the main window",
  "windows": ["main"],
  "permissions": [
    "core:path:default",
    "core:event:default",
    "core:window:default",
    "core:app:default",
    "core:resources:default",
    "core:menu:default",
    "core:tray:default",
    "core:window:allow-set-title"
  ]
}
```

These snippets are part of the
[Tauri configuration](/develop/configuration-files/#tauri-config) file.

This is likely the most common configuration method,
where the individual capabilities are inlined and only
permissions are referenced by identifier.

This requires well defined
capability files in the `capabilities` directory.

```json title=src-tauri/tauri.conf.json
{
  "app": {
    "security": {
      "capabilities": ["my-capability", "main-capability"]
    }
  }
}
```

Inline capabilities can be mixed with pre-defined capabilities.

```json title=src-tauri/tauri.conf.json
{
  "app": {
    "security": {
      "capabilities": [
        {
          "identifier": "my-capability",
          "description": "My application capability used for all windows",
          "windows": ["*"],
          "permissions": ["fs:default", "allow-home-read-extended"]
        },
        "my-second-capability"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Target Platform

Capabilities can be platform-specific by defining the `platforms` array.
By default the capability is applied to all targets,
but you can select a subset of the `linux`, `macOS`, `windows`, `iOS` and `android` targets.

For example a capability for desktop operating systems.
Note it enables permissions on plugins that are only available on desktop:

```json title="src-tauri/capabilities/desktop.json"
{
  "$schema": "./schemas/desktop-schema.json",
  "identifier": "desktop-capability",
  "windows": ["main"],
  "platforms": ["linux", "macOS", "windows"],
  "permissions": ["global-shortcut:allow-register"]
}
```

And another example of a capability for mobile.
Note it enables permissions on plugins that are only available on mobile:

```json title="src-tauri/capabilities/mobile.json"
{
  "$schema": "./schemas/mobile-schema.json",
  "identifier": "mobile-capability",
  "windows": ["main"],
  "platforms": ["iOS", "android"],
  "permissions": [
    "nfc:allow-scan",
    "biometric:allow-authenticate",
    "barcode-scanner:allow-scan"
  ]
}
```

## Remote API Access

By default the API is only accessible to bundled code shipped with the Tauri App.
To allow remote sources access to certain Tauri Commands it is possible to define this in
the capability configuration file.

This example would allow to scan for NFC tags and to use the barcode scanner from
all subdomains of `tauri.app`.

```json title="src-tauri/capabilities/remote-tags.json"
{
	"$schema": "./schemas/remote-schema.json",
	"identifier": "remote-tag-capability",
	"windows": ["main"],
	"remote": {
		"urls": ["https://*.tauri.app"]
	},
	"platforms": ["iOS", "android"],
	"permissions": [
		"nfc:allow-scan",
		"barcode-scanner:allow-scan"
	]
}
```

:::caution

On Linux and Android, Tauri is unable to distinguish between requests from an embedded `<iframe>` and the window itself.

Please consider usage of this feature very carefully and read more into the specific
security implications for your targeted operating system in the reference section of this feature.

:::

## Security Boundaries

_What does it protect against?_

Depending on the permissions and capabilities it is able to:

- Minimize impact of frontend compromise
- Prevent or reduce (accidential) exposure of local system interfaces and data
- Prevent or reduce possible privilege escalation from frontend to backend/system

_What does it **not** protect against?_

- Malicious or insecure Rust code
- Too lax scopes and configuration
- Incorrect scope checks in the command implementation
- Intentional bypasses from Rust code
- Basically anything which was written in the rust core of an application
- 0-days or unpatched 1-days in the system WebView
- Supply chain attacks or otherwise compromised developer systems

:::tip[Security Tip]

The security boundaries are depending on window labels (**not titles**).
We recommend to only expose of the window creation functionality
to higher privileged windows.

## Schema Files

Tauri generates a JSON schema with all the permissions that are available to your
application so you have autocompletion in your IDE.
To use the schema, set the `$schema` property to one of the schemas
inside the `gen/schemas` directory, which are platform-specific.
Usually you will set it to `../gen/schemas/desktop-schema.json` or
`../gen/schemas/mobile-schema.json` though you can also define a capability
for a specific target platform.

## Configuration Files

Simplified example of an example Tauri application directory structure:

```sh
tauri-app
├── index.html
├── package.json
├── src
├── src-tauri
│   ├── Cargo.toml
│   ├── capabilities
│      └── <identifier>.json/toml
│   ├── src
│   ├── tauri.conf.json
```

Everything can be inlined into the `tauri.conf.json` but even a
little more advanced configuration would bloat this file and
the goal of this approach is that the permissions are abstracted
away whenever possible and simple to understand.

## Core Permissions

A list of all core permissions can be found on the [Core Permissions](/reference/acl/core-permissions/) page.
